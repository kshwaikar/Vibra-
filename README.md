üí° Key Code Features
localStorage Management: The app uses localStorage to save and retrieve all user data. This includes:

userData: Stores the user's profile object.

userHabitsList: Stores the user's list of custom habit strings.

completedHabitsToday: Stores which habits have been checked today. It automatically resets if the date changes.

lastMood: Remembers the last mood selected for theme persistence.

Dynamic DOM Rendering: The habit list is not hard-coded in HTML. The renderHabitList() function in script.js dynamically generates the HTML for each habit from the userHabits array, including its completion state.

CSS Variables for Theming: The app's theme is controlled by a CSS variable (--primary-color). The changeTheme() JavaScript function updates this variable based on the selected mood, and all other colors in the CSS update automatically.

Rule-Based Chatbot: The chatBotResponse() function uses simple keyword matching to provide helpful and contextual responses without needing an external AI API.
